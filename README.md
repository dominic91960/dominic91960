## Hello
I'm currently an undergraduate student with a keen interest in full stack development. While I don't have industrial experience yet, I am actively working on projects to develop my skills.

**Projects I'm currently working on:**
- **3D Printer Management App:** A mobile app using React Native and Expo CLI for managing and monitoring 3D printers, with backend services powered by AppWrite.
